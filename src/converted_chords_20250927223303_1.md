Cm - Fm - Gm

Cm - Fm - Gm

 

 

[Verse 1]

 

[Cm]

I wanna be your vacuum cleaner

[Fm]                [Gm]

breathing in your dust

[Cm]

I wanna be your Ford Cortina

[Fm]           [Gm]

I will never rust

[Cm]

If you like your coffee hot

[Fm]                    [Gm]

let me be your coffee pot

[Cm]

You call the shots babe

       [Fm]            [Gm]

I just wanna be yours

 

 

[Pre-chorus 1]

 

[Fm]             [Gm]

Secrets I have held in my heart

[Cm]            [Fm]

are harder to hide than I thought

[Fm]           [Gm]

Maybe I just wanna be yours

 

 

[Chorus]

 

  [Cm]

I wanna be yours

  [Bb]                [Ab]

[Verse 2]

 

[Cm]

Let me be your leccy meter

[Fm]                 [Gm]

And I'll never run out

    [Cm]

Let me be the portable heater

[Fm]                       [Gm]

That youâ€™ll get cold without

[Cm]

I wanna be your setting lotion (Wanna be...)

[Fm]                        [Gm]

hold your hair in deep devotion (How deep...?)

N.C.

At least as deep as the Pacific ocean

  [Fm]            [Gm]

I wanna be yours

 

 

[Pre-chorus 2]

 

[Fm]             [Gm]

Secrets I have held in my heart

Maybe I just wanna be yours

[Outro]

 

[Ab]

 Wanna be your vacuum cleaner

[Cm]                  [Bb]

  breathing in your dust

[Ab]

 I wanna be your Ford Cortina
